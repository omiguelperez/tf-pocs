You must have your AWS profile already configured. In this repository I'm not show how to configure your AWS CLI, only Terraform samples. 

To select your AWS profile you can expose the `AWS_PROFILE` variables as below:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=my_profile
```

After that, you are able to use your Terraform commands like plan, apply, destroy, etc.
